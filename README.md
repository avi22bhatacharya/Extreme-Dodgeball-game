# Extreme-Dodgeball-game
This is a simple yet fun game for anyone who is bored out there. Since pygames can't be published on the internet, I'll be putting the code here and all the necessary files you need to download to play the game. Hope you all enjoy it :)
The controls are pretty simple, up arrow to go upwards, down arrow to go downwards, right arrow to go rightwards, and left arrow to go leftwards. There is a special 'teleport' move available which can be used by pressing space however this skill is only available every 15 seconds. 
There is a small glitch with the animations so I hope you can ignore that however it just affects the design, not the running of the program.
